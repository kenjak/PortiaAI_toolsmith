# PortiaAI-Toolsmith
- ### **Project Overview**
This project had the aim of creating a tool that portia can use to make custom tools- removing the main obstacle in doing anything useful with portia. At the moment, the toolsmith.py file generates python code that implements the functionality prompted by the user. This code is then reviewed and is passed back into the toolsmith.py file. The future extension is to have another file that will translate python code into a useable tool for portia. Various test files would also be made to ensure thatthe written code does what it says.

- ### **SetUp**
This project needs to be run in a venv with the portia-sdk installed. Additionally, when running the code you will need to add your own .env file with the necessary API keys.

- ### **Technologies used**
This project made use of Portia with an OpenAI LLM API

- ### **Examples and Demo**
Please see the other files besides toolsmith.py and review_tool.py to see the type of code that this Portia can generate.
