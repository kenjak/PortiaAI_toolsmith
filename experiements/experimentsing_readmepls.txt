A different setup for generating tools that worked but was also quite tempermental with portiaAI, below is a tool it managed to create to assess code, it required a more rigid framework to produce code like this, as a result the code is normally better off bat however it still requires a basis of what the tool should look like and how it should be formatted, our Toolsmith requires only a prompt to begin working.
